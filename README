Usage Overview
--------------
On dev/build, additional fields will be added to the class Page - HasGooglePlusOne which is a
Boolean, and PlusOneButtonSize, which is of Enum data type. These added fields can be found in
under the Google Plus One tab in the admin. If you wish to display a Google +1 in your page, just
check on the tick box 'Use Google Plus One on this page?'. Then, the Google Plus One Button Sizes
field will be enabled so you can select a size for the button. As you hover on each button sizes,
a corresponding image will be displayed on the right side of the field. After the page has been saved
and published, the button can be seen after you call the ImplementsGooglePlusOne method in your template.
e.g. <div class="sample-class">$ImplementsGooglePlusOne</div>
